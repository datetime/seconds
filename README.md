Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/seconds/issues)

I'd like to implement the following if someone wants to do a PR before I get around to them:

 - ~~`today`: function to calculate seconds since beginning of the day~~
 - `month`: function to calculate seconds since beginning of the month
 - `year`: function to calculate seconds since beginning of the year

I'm also open to other ideas for this lib.
